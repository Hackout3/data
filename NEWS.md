outbreaks 2.0.0 (to be released)
================================

This version is a **refactoring of existing datasets**.
Previous datasets have been moved in `/data-raw` and prefixed by `leg_` (for legacy).

Note: If for compatibility reason you need to use the previous version of the datasets, 
you can load them by running `legacy_mode()`.

### Global changes

* **Technical changes**
  * tibble
    * Convert each dataset to `tibble`.
    * Import from `tibble` in order to get consistent behaviour regardless of whether or not `tibble` is attached.
  * tsibble
    * Optional possibility to use data as `tsibble`
    * Benefit from Tidy tools for time series, see [tidyverts](https://tidyverts.org/).
  * Tests
    * Include a test for each dataset through [testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/).
    * Run tests in Travis CI.
    * Structure tests: Test if the dataset structure (format) is correct
    * Data tests: Test if the dataset data (content) is correct
    * Timeseries tests: Test if the dataset is a valid timeseries (regular, ordered, 
      no duplication, no gaps)
    * TODO: Some tests could be factorized see http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html
  * Include a `Makefile` for common tasks.
* **Documentation**
  * Turning on markdown support for Roxygen, see [Turning on markdown support](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/rd-formatting.html#turning-on-markdown-support).
  * Detailed description of the dataset is including in the "Details" section (instead of "Format").
  * Dedicated section "Licence" added to mention clearly the licence if it's known -> [#7](https://github.com/reconhub/outbreaks/issues/7).
  * Define `@family` with disease name in order to find similar datasets easily.
* **Dataset structure**
  * Variables are in lower case.
  * Stick to **tidy data** principle
  * Some common variables
    * `id`: Unique identification
    * `age`: Age of individual
    * `date_of_onset` (`Date`): Date of symptom onset
    * `date_of_report` (`Date`): Date of reporting
    * `gender`: Gender of individual as a factor with two values ("male", "female")
    * `incidence` (`integer`): Incidence is given as the number of new cases reported
    * `age`: Age of individual
    * `age_group`: Age grouping
    * `geo`: Geographical coordinates (must be two columns)
* **Process**
  * Write a "contributing guide" -> #TODO

### Dengue & Zika datasets Funk et al. (2016)

Datasets: `dengue_fais_2011_td`, `dengue_yap_2011_td`, `zika_yap_2007_td`.

* **Technical changes**
  * Include the code used to download the source file and 
  generate datasets in `data-raw/` as stated in *[R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/data.html)* book.
* **Format**
  * `onset_date` -> `date_of_onset`(standardization)
  * `nr` -> Removed since it can be computed
  * `value`-> `incidence` (`integer`)
* **Documentation**
  * Apply general documentation rules

### Ebola in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of the Congo, 1995

Datasets: `ebola_kikwit_1995`

*Source data not available.*

It was a sparse dataset, there is no event when reporting is FALSE so
* Replace data when reporting is `FALSE` by `NA`

```R
leg_ebola_kikwit_1995 %>% group_by(reporting) %>% summarise_if(is.numeric, sum)

# A tibble: 2 x 3
# reporting onset death
# <lgl>     <int> <int>
# 1 FALSE         0     0
# 2 TRUE        292   236
```

* **Format**
  * Replace missing values (`reporting == FALSE` with `NA`)
  * `date` -> `date_of_onset`(standardization)
  * `onset`-> `incidence` (standardization)
  * `death` (no change)
  * `reporting` -> removed

* **Documentation**
  * Apply general documentation rules
  * Fixed the number of incidence is 292 and not 291

### Ebola in Sierra Leone, 2014

* **Format**
  * `id` (no change)
  * `age` (no change)
  * `sex` -> `gender`
  * `status` (no change)
  * `date_of_onset` (no change)
  * `date_of_sample`(no change)
  * `district` (no change)
  * `chiefdom` (no change)

### Influenza A H7N9 in China, 2013
