These data describe incidence of clinical cases of Dengue
on the Yap Main Islands, Micronesia.
}
\details{
The data on Dengue incidence reported by Funk et al. (2016) cover the period
from 2011-07-07 to 2012-04-12, over which time a total of 978 cases were
reported among 7391 residents. Suspected Dengue cases were identified by the
Yap Department of Health, using the WHO (2009) case definition. A small
proportion of cases (9\%) were reported on outer islands and included in the
time series for the Yap Main Islands. Dengue virus serotype 2 was confirmed by
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction by the CDC Dengue Branch,
Puerto Rico.
